Ever wonder why everyone hates Mondays? Or why are we witnessing the ‘end-of-times’ style collapse of modern society? Or why you work your ass off everyday and still struggle to get by? Our answer: it’s not you, it’s capitalism! Socialist activists Monica Cruz & Rachel Hu join southern-raised cultural educator and organizer Ciara Taylor to talk all things feminist, political, and cultural. In a vanilla media landscape swamped with empty analysis, It’s Not You, It’s Capitalism brings you a critical dose of BS-free conversation and progressive politics.<br>
